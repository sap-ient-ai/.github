# What is sap.ient.ai?

> ***sapient***  
>    Imbued with wisdom. Derived from the Latin _sapor_, meaning flavour / taste / discernment.  
>  
> ***artificial***  
>     Made through skill and art. Derived from the Latin word _artificialis_ (_ars_ meaning "art, skill," _-ficialis_ implying "making" or "doing.".  
>  
> ***intelligence***  
>     Derived rom the Latin "intelligere.", meaning to comprehend or perceive.

An open collective of curious creative engineering minds dedicated to exploring and advancing the frontier of AI.  
_Created on 24 November 2023 (**pi**, **Bojan**)_

We spend our time (mostly on Discord) collectively figuring out the best thing we could be building, and building it. 

We welcome careful drivers.


## Vision

Humans are at a critical evolutionary point. Now is a good time to align, focus, grind, know thyself. We need to get this right.

Identifying a good frontier-point from which to advance is difficult, as it involves hitting a moving target -- keeping abreast of publications and predicting trajectories; work takes time.

e.g. Last year LLMs had 4k context windows, now 100k(in) + 8k(out) is available. This changes the game for agentic systems.

We are in the process of building a product, forming a company, spinning the money wheel, buying GPU time plus the freedom to fund an AI research lab.


## TLDR
This is a hub for freestyle exploration (theory) / engineering (code) of intelligent systems.

We seek to build intuition and clear understanding, designing solutions that are elegant, simple and effective.

Cross-Domain wins: Physics / NeuroBioChem / Algebra+Geometry / DynamicalSystems / InformationTheory / Prob/Stats...

OutOfTheBox: Intuition leads, theory sometimes follows.

Random keywords: Bio-inspired, Neuromorphic, Sparsity, Attention, Gating, Recurrence, Diffusion, Reinforcement, Agency, Saccades, BackPropagation, ForwardForward. All good ingredients for the Quantum Soup.

Hands-on. Can you code it?


## Who are we?

Most of us are listed on the Discord in the `/intros` channel.

Here are some of the things we are working on:
- (***pi****)           An agentic system that self-evolves under human guidance
- (***Bojan***)         Full Spectrum research, Alignment
- (***CatId***)         LLM architecture, local deployment, fine-tuning
- (***BeeGass***)       SSM innovations
- (***GreyGoo***)       Fullstack dev (AI-centric)
- (***Hong***)          Research / mathy things
- (***Buttercutter***)  Neuromorphic / Quantum

## GPU sponsorship and investment

We're looking for two A100 GPUs to use for a few weeks.

We want to host our own Llama3 70B model and develop a (multi-GPU) chassis for evaluating LLM fine-tuning / alignment strategies.

Is there anyone out there that has one we can use? If so, please contact pipad.org@gmail.com, and we would be proud to acknowledge out sponsor(s) here.

Once we have a stable product, we'll want to offer a web-service and scale up to meet demand. But one step at a time.

## What do we DO?
We spend our time:
- figuring out the GOAL (eternal WiP) -- yes money is nice, but what is our desired outcome as humans building AI?
- figuring out how to get there:
    - honing awareness of the [OBSTACLES](wiki#problems-with-current-ai-and-inspirations-from-biology) taking inspiration from biology
    - monitoring SotA AI (lots of reading arXiv (etc.) papers)
    - improving our understanding
    - building/creating stuff (active exploration, tinkering)
