This is a hub for freestyle exploration (theory) / engineering (code) of intelligent systems.

We seek to build intuition and clear understanding, designing solutions that are elegant, simple and effective.

Cross-Domain wins: Physics / NeuroBioChem / Algebra+Geometry / DynamicalSystems / InformationTheory / Prob/Stats...

OutOfTheBox: Intuition leads, theory sometimes follows.

Random keywords: Sparsity, Attention, Gating, Diffusion, ReinforcementLearning, GeometricAlgebra, Capsules, FourierTheory, Agency, Saccades, BackPropagation, ForwardForward. All good ingredients for the Quantum Soup.

Hands-on. Can you code it?

## What are we currently up to?

We started by picking apart FFF (https://github.com/sap-ient-ai/FFF)

We're currently investigating MAMBA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752)
