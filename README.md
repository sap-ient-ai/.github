This is a hub for freestyle exploration (theory) / engineering (code) of intelligent systems.

We seek to build intuition and clear understanding, designing solutions that are elegant, simple and effective.

Cross-Domain wins: Physics / NeuroBioChem / Algebra+Geometry / DynamicalSystems / InformationTheory / Prob/Stats...

OutOfTheBox: Intuition leads, theory sometimes follows.

Random keywords: Sparsity, Attention, Gating, Diffusion, ReinforcementLearning, GeometricAlgebra, Capsules, FourierTheory, Agency, Saccades,  BackPropagation, ForwardForward. All good ingredients for the Quantum Soup.

Hands-on. Can you code it?
